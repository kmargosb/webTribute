    <h1 align="center" >Bad Religion</h1>

    <p>
        <strong>Bad Religion</strong> is an American punk rock band that formed in <strong>Los Angeles</strong>,
        California, in 1980. The band's lyrics
        cover topics related to religion, politics, society, the media and science. Musically, they are noted for their
        melodicn sensibilities and extensive use of three-part vocal harmonies. The band has experienced multiple
        line-up changes, with singer <strong>Greg Graffin</strong> being the band's only constant member, though fellow
        founding members <strong>Jay Bentley</strong> and <strong>Brettn Gurewitz</strong> have also been with the band
        for most of their history while guitarist <strong>Brian Baker</strong> has been a member of the group since
        1994. Guitarist <strong>Mike Dimkich</strong> and drummer <strong>Jamie Miller</strong> have been
        members of the band since 2013 and 2015 respectively. To date, Bad Religion has released seventeen studio
        albums, two live albums, three compilation albums, three EPs, and two live DVDs. They are considered to be one
        of the best-selling punk rock acts of all time,<sup>[1]</sup> having sold over five million albums
        worldwide.<sup>[2]</sup>

    <p> After gaining a large underground following and critical praise through their releases on Gurewitz's label
        Epitaph in the 1980s and early 1990s, Bad Religion experienced mainstream success after signing to the major
        label Atlantic in 1993. Bad Religion pioneered the punk rock revival movement of the 1990s, establishing a
        formula for California-based punk bands such as Green Day and Epitaph-signed acts the Offspring, NOFX and
        Rancid.[3] Atlantic reissued the previously-released-on-Epitaph album, Recipe for Hate (1993), which became
        commercially successful, as did its 1994 follow-up Stranger than Fiction.[4] Stranger than Fiction included some
        of Bad Religion's well-known hits, including "Infected", "Stranger than Fiction", and the re-recorded version of
        "21st Century (Digital Boy)";[4] the album was later certified gold in both the United States and Canada.

    <p> Shortly before the release of Stranger than Fiction, Gurewitz left Bad Religion to run his label Epitaph on a
        full-time basis, and was replaced by Brian Baker. The band's success had slowly dwindled by the late 1990s, and,
        after three more albums, they were dropped from Atlantic in 2001; this resulted in Bad Religion returning to Epitaph
        and Gurewitz rejoining the band. Since then, they have undergone a resurgence in popularity, with "Sorrow", "Los
        Angeles Is Burning", and "The Devil in Stitches" being Top 40 hits on the US charts while their sixteenth studio
        album, True North (2013), became Bad Religion's first album to crack the top 20 on the Billboard 200 chart where it
        peaked at number 19.[4] The band's seventeenth and most recent studio album, Age of Unreason, was released on May 3,
        2019.[5]
